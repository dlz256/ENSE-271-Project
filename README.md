## Summarized project background & business need/opportunity

The South Saskatchewan Community Foundation (SSCF) needs us to find a way to make the Vital Signs PDF report more interactive by creating a website that people can engage with, creating more empathy and relatability with the communities in need. 

Overall the goal is to use key aspects of the Vital Signs PDF report to highlight the charities they support in order to drive donor, community, and government engagement with their charities while simultaneously showing how their organization's support has a positive impact. 

#### Northstar & carryover customers: 

The donors are the Northstar customers as they are the ones that will be engaging with the website the most. We want these donors to feel like they can relate to the community that they are donating to and make an impact on real life problems.
One of the carryover customers include the charities as they will be the ones on the receiving end of the donations and can let people know how much is being donated where and the gap of what is needed in each community. Other carryover customers include volunteers and government officials as they will keep up with the progress of donations and be more engaged to donate themselves. Also, the community itself are carryover customers because they would be more aware of ongoing projects in their area.
