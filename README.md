## Summarized project background & business need/opportunity

The South Saskatchewan Community Foundation (SSCF) needs us to find a way to make the Vital Signs PDF report more interactive by creating a website that people can engage with, creating more empathy and relatability with the communities in need. 

Overall the goal is to use key aspects of the Vital Signs PDF report to highlight the charities they support in order to drive donor, community, and government engagement with their charities while simultaneously showing how their organization's support has a positive impact. 

#### Northstar & carryover customers: 

The donors are the Northstar customers as they are the ones that will be engaging with the website the most. We want these donors to feel like they can relate to the community that they are donating to and make an impact on real life problems.
One of the carryover customers include the charities as they will be the ones on the receiving end of the donations and can let people know how much is being donated where and the gap of what is needed in each community. Other carryover customers include volunteers and government officials as they will keep up with the progress of donations and be more engaged to donate themselves. Also, the community itself are carryover customers because they would be more aware of ongoing projects in their area.

#### Project assumptions
- The format will be a browser created on WordPress. 
- The data will be provided by the client and will only serve as a template to be replaced by the real data if chosen. 
- The majority of users  are looking to donate but are unsure of where to donate to or how to donate. 
- The users do not want a format like the current PDF - Very little scrolling/little effort to find desired information.
- Real time issues.
- Concise image, statement, and impact report that highlights needs and impact.
#### Project constraints
Resources:
- Since we are using Wordpress, we are limited by its functionality and pre-made (free version) designs. Also due to the limited knowledge of wordpress in the design stage 
- The data provided to us will only be a template, leading to constraints in filtering options as we may not know exactly what filter options to include.

Client feedback:
- Revisions will need to be done which may take time away from other tasks. 
- No IT support, need compatible for individuals with little website/database understanding.
- Some information is second hand or inferred by one stakeholder on behalf of the others â†’ SSCF is telling us what they want AND assuming what stakeholders like charities and donors want/need. 
- We do not have direct confirmation from other stakeholders
